## Install

The best way to install is over [pelican-themes](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes).

The alternative way is to clone this repository. The `master` branch is stable and is safe to checkout, but I would recommend you to checkout a tag branch.

## Documentation

The documentation covers most of the settings available and how to use this theme.
If something is missing or broken you can open a PR or fix the documentation by yourself.

## Contributing

**ALWAYS** open an issue before sending a PR.

As always, if you want something that only makes sense to you, fork Flex and create a new theme.
